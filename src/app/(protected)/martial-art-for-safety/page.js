      <div className='font-bold mt-8 text-xl mb-2'> 1. Hammer strike</div>
      <p>
        Using your car keys is one of the easiest ways to defend yourself.
        Don&apos;t use your fingernails, because you&apos;re more at risk to
        injure your hands. Instead, if you feel unsafe while walking at night,
        have your keys stick out from one side of your fist for hammer strikes.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        Another way to use your keys is to click them onto a lanyard to swing at
        your attacker.

      <p>
        To perform:
        <ul className='pl-8 list-decimal'>
          <li>
            Hold your key ring in a tight fist, like holding a hammer, with keys
            extending from the side of your hand.
          </li>
          <li>Thrust downward toward your target.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <div className='font-bold mt-8 text-xl mb-2'> 2. Groin kick</div>
      <p>
        If someone is coming at you from the front, a groin kick may deliver
        enough force to paralyze your attacker, making your escape possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        To perform:
        <ul className='pl-8 list-decimal'>
          <li>Stabilize yourself as best you can.</li>
          <li>
            Lift your dominant leg off the ground and begin to drive your knee
            upward.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extend your dominant leg, drive hips forward, slightly lean back,
            and kick forcefully, making contact between your lower shin or ball
            of your foot and the attacker&apos;s groin area.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <div className='font-bold mt-8 text-xl mb-2'>3. Heel palm strike</div>
      <p>
        This move can cause damage to the nose or throat. To execute, get in
        front of your attacker as much as is possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        To perform:
        <ul className='pl-8 list-decimal'>
          <li>With your dominant hand, flex your wrist. </li>
          <li>
            Aim for either the attacker&apos;s nose, jabbing upward from the
            nostrils, or underneath the attacker&apos;s chin, jabbing upward at
            the throat.{' '}
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure to recoil your strike. Pulling your arm back quickly will
            help thrust the attacker&apos;s head up and back.
          </li>
          <li>
            This will cause your attacker to stagger backward, allowing you to
            escape their grasp.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <div className='font-bold mt-8 text-xl mb-2'>4. Elbow strike</div>
      <p>
        If your attacker is in close range and you&apos;re unable to get enough
        momentum to throw a strong punch or kick, use your elbows.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        To perform:
        <ul className='pl-8 list-decimal'>
          <li>With your dominant hand, flex your wrist. </li>
          <li>
            If you can, stabilize yourself with a strong core and legs to ensure
            a powerful blow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bend your arm at the elbow, shift your weight forward, and strike
            your elbow into your attacker&apos;s neck, jawline, chin, or temple.
            These are all effective targets.
          </li>
          <li>
            This may cause your attacker to loosen their grip, allowing you to
            run.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <div className='font-bold mt-8 text-xl mb-2'>5. Alternative elbow strikes</div>
      <p>
        Depending on how you&apos;re standing when you&apos;re initially
        attacked, you may be in a better position for variations on the elbow
        strike.
      </p>

        className='my-2'
        alt=''
      />
      <p>
        To perform from the front:
        <ul className='pl-8 list-decimal'>
          <li>Lift your elbow to shoulder height.</li>
          <li>
            Pivot on same-side foot and allow your hips to rotate, creating more
            momentum into the front part of your elbow when you strike.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        To perform from the back:
        <ul className='pl-8 list-decimal'>
          <li>Make sure you see the target.</li>
          <li>
            Bring your elbow up and pivot your opposite foot, rotating your hips
            and turning into the target, making contact with the back part of
            your elbow.
          </li>
        </ul>

        6. Escape from a &apos;bear hug attack&apos;
      </div>
      <p>
        For cases where the attacker is coming from behind, you&apos;ll want to
        use this move. Focus on getting low and creating space to free yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        To perform:
        <ul className='pl-8 list-decimal'>
          <li>
            Bend forward from the waist. This shifts your weight forward, making
            it more difficult for your attacker to pick you up. It also gives
            you a better angle to throw elbows from side to side to the
            attacker&apos;s face.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn into the attacker with one of your elbows and continue
            counterattacking.
          </li>
          <li>
            This should give you space to turn fully, using another move to
            injure the face or strike the groin. With the space these moves have
            created, you may be able to escape and run away.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <div className='font-bold mt-8 text-xl mb-2'>7. Escape with hands trapped</div>
      <p>
        If your attacker comes from behind and traps your arms (this is similar
        to a bear hug, but you won&apos;t be able to move as freely),
        here&apos;s what to do:
      </p>
      <img

        className='my-2'
        alt=''
      />
      <p>
        To perform:
        <ul className='pl-8 list-decimal'>
          <li>
            First reaction should be to stop your attacker&apos;s arms from
            going higher into a headlock. Shift your hips to one side. This
            gives an opening for strikes to the groin with open-handed slaps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring your hand back up to your arms and raise your opposite elbow
            to turn into the wrap. Keep your arms tight to your chest as
            you&apos;re turning in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stay aggressive with your knees and other counterattacks until you
            can disengage.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <div className='font-bold mt-8 text-xl mb-2'>8. Escape from side headlock</div>
      <p>
        When the attacker locks their arm around your head from the side, your
        first instinct should be to avoid getting choked.
      </p>

      <p>
        To perform:
        <ul className='pl-8 list-decimal'>
          <li>
            Turn into the attacker&apos;s side as much as possible to avoid
            being choked.
          </li>
          <li>
            With your hand that&apos;s furthest away, strike the groin with
            open-handed slaps until you have enough mobility to turn your head
            all the way out to disengage.
          </li>
        </ul>
